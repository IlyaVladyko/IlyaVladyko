## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a computational physics project for biomedical imaging applications, expanding my expertise in objective-C/Metal.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced techniques in HPC (High Performance Computing) and exploring Monte Carlo (MC) methods for simulation accuracy.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that need physical system modelling, optical/thermal simulations, or scientific software development.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with implementing microservice strategies for scalable, simulation-driven applications.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about coding in Python, C++, Objective-C, and Metal for high-performance applications, Computer Vision!
ðŸ“« How to reach me: ilya.vladyko@vuw.ac.nz
âš¡ Fun fact: I love diving deep into the physics behind everyday systems â€” from how your coffee cools down to how thermal implants work!
